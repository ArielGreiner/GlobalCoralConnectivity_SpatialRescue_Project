# GlobalCoralConnectivity_SpatialRescue_Project
Code used to generate results for Greiner et al. 2022 Global Ecology and Biogeography. All code was generated by me (Ariel Greiner) unless stated explicitly in the file itself. All outputs were generated between 2017-2021. Please contact me if you have any issues running the code. R was used to generate and manipulate all of the data used in this project, although some data were generated in a server farm (compute canada, https://www.computecanada.ca/, server farm accessible to Canadian researchers) and BASH code was used to run the R code in those instances.

Please feel free to use and borrow from this code base according to the licence below.
