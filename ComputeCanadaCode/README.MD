This folder contains an example of a BASH code launcher that will work in the Beluga server farm in computecanada and the code that I used to generate some of the results in the paper.
Due to constraints of run time and memory some of this code was run in pieces and not as displayed, but how exactly it should be broken up and ran is going to be entirely dependent on the server farm in question.
If you want to run this on another type of external server, this code will likely need edits that are specific to the server in question.
